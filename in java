Given a sorted array, arr[] and a number target, you need to find the number of occurrences of target in arr[]. 

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], target = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: target = 2 occurs 4 times in the given array so the output is 4.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], target = 4
Output: 0
Explanation: target = 4 is not present in the given array so the output is 0.
Input: arr[] = [8, 9, 10, 12, 12, 12], target = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: target = 12 occurs 3 times in the given array so the output is 3.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
1 ≤ target ≤ 106

Solution

class Solution {
    int countFreq(int[] arr, int target) {
        int first = findFirstOccurrence(arr, target);
        if (first == -1) {
            // Target not found
            return 0;
        }
        int last = findLastOccurrence(arr, target);
        return last - first + 1;
    }

    private static int findFirstOccurrence(int[] arr, int target) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
        int result = -1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] == target) {
                result = mid;
                high = mid - 1; // Move left to find earlier occurrences
            } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    private static int findLastOccurrence(int[] arr, int target) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
        int result = -1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] == target) {
                result = mid;
                low = mid + 1; // Move right to find later occurrences
            } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    }
